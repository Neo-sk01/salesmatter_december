# Cold Outreach Email Generation — SKILL.md
> Lead Generation Agency | Cold Email Specialist System

## Overview

This skill governs the creation of all cold outreach emails. Every email produced MUST follow the **Carl Davis XYZ Formula** — a 6-component messaging structure designed for natural, conversational, high-converting cold outreach. No exceptions.

---

## THE CARL DAVIS XYZ FORMULA — NON-NEGOTIABLE STRUCTURE

Every email must be built from these 6 messaging components in order. Each component has a specific role. Do not skip, merge, or reorder them.

---

### COMPONENT 1 — CONNECTION
**Template slot:** `"Hello [Name], I'm [Your Name] with [Company]."`

This is the hook. It MUST signal that this is NOT a mass email. Use research, social proof, or a mutual reference. The prospect must feel specifically chosen.

**Approved connection openers:**
- `"I was talking to [name] and I understand you/your organization is now…"`
- `"On your website I saw that you are now…"`
- `"I saw your article in [publication]…"`
- `"I saw an article about your company in [publication]…"`
- `"I was talking to our mutual LinkedIn connection [name] who mentioned that you…"`
- `"A mutual acquaintance, [name], suggested I contact you…"`
- `"I see that [initiative] is one of your major priorities for the year…"`
- `"I saw your post on [platform]…"`
- `"I heard that your company is now experiencing [situation]…"`
- `"I understand your organization is in the process of [action]…"`

**Rules:**
- Always personalise. Generic openers are disqualified.
- Reference a real, verifiable detail: a LinkedIn post, a press mention, a company initiative, a shared connection, or website content.
- Keep to 1–2 sentences.

---

### COMPONENT 2 — SPECIALTY
**Template slot:** `"We specialize in working with [specific person, role, or organization type]…"`

This is where you establish relevance and authority. Name exactly who you work with so the prospect self-identifies.

**Examples of specialty descriptors:**
- Job titles: IT Managers, HR Directors, Marketing Executives, CEOs, Media Buyers
- Organization types: Independent agencies, family-owned businesses, luxury brands, franchise operations, dental practices, SaaS companies
- Situation-based: Companies scaling their paid media, brands entering new markets, businesses experiencing high churn

**Rules:**
- Be specific. "Companies" is too vague. "Fast-growing e-commerce brands" is not.
- This line should feel like you're describing *them* exactly.

---

### COMPONENT 3 — POSSIBLE PROBLEM OR DESIRE
**Template slot:** `"…who [are experiencing / are looking for / need / that…]"`

Articulate the pain or goal you already know they likely have. This is not a question — it's a confident, empathetic statement that shows you understand their world.

**Examples:**
- `"…who are looking for more targeted digital traffic…"`
- `"…who are having challenges keeping up with customer service demand…"`
- `"…that need a 24/7 solution for security monitoring…"`
- `"…that experience more downtime than they'd like…"`
- `"…who are considering automating their project management…"`
- `"…who want to access an underserved but high-spending audience segment…"`
- `"…who are struggling to justify ad spend without clear attribution…"`

**Rules:**
- Do NOT frame this as a question. Frame it as an insight.
- Choose ONE core problem or desire — don't list multiple.
- It must be plausible and realistic for their role and industry.

---

### COMPONENT 4 — POSSIBLE VALUE
**Template slot:** `"We help them [minimization/maximization verb] their [undesired/desired noun]."`

This is your value statement. Use either pain avoidance language OR desired gain language — or both, joined with "and/or."

#### Pain Avoidance (use minimization verbs + undesired noun):
**Minimization Verbs:** save · salvage · free up · consolidate · minimize · decrease · cut down on · eliminate · get rid of · reduce · lessen · cut · lower · soften · slash · shrink · slice · trim · combine · modify

**Undesired Nouns:** wasted spend · inefficiency · missed leads · compliance risk · downtime · churn · ad fatigue · poor attribution · manual processes · lost revenue

#### Desired Gain (use maximization verbs + desired noun):
**Maximization Verbs:** strengthen · intensify · reinforce · boost · increase · expand · add · grow · maximize · enhance · create · build · ease

**Desired Nouns:** profits · sales · revenue · cash flow · productivity · market share · conversions · engagement · brand authority · pipeline · ROI · output · savings · time · morale

**Rules:**
- Keep this to 1–2 sentences.
- Do NOT list features. Speak to outcomes.
- Use language that mirrors how *they* would describe the result, not how you sell it.

---

### COMPONENT 5 — END RESULT
**Template slot:** `"This results in…" / "What this means is…" / "For our clients this has meant…"`

Quantify wherever possible. Make the outcome tangible and credible.

**Examples:**
- `"For our clients this has resulted in gains ranging from 10%–50%."`
- `"What this typically means is a significant decrease in wasted ad spend, in some cases up to 40%."`
- `"Most of our clients see a measurable lift in qualified pipeline within the first 60 days."`
- `"This means their campaigns reach audiences with 60%+ degree-holding professionals in decision-making roles."`

**Rules:**
- If you have real data, use it. If not, use directional language ("significant," "measurable," "notable").
- Never fabricate specific numbers without a source.
- Keep to 1–2 sentences.

---

### COMPONENT 6 — TRANSITION TO QUESTIONING (CTA)
**Template slot:** `"I'd like to [action verb] to [ending phrase]."`

Close the email with a soft, low-friction ask. The goal is a conversation, not a sale.

**Action Verbs:**
- `"Discuss your situation…"`
- `"Ask a few questions about…"`
- `"Review what you are currently doing for…"`
- `"Go through your requirements for…"`
- `"Find out about…"`

**Ending Phrases:**
- `"…to see if I could provide you with some useful information."`
- `"…to see if you'd like to explore this further."`
- `"…to determine if we might have a reason to speak."`
- `"…to see if this could be of value to you."`
- `"…to see if we have options worth taking a look at."`

**Rules:**
- Never ask for a sale, a demo, or a commitment in the first email.
- The CTA must be a question or a soft suggestion — never a demand.
- One CTA only. Do not stack multiple asks.

---

## SUBJECT LINE RULES

The subject line is the gatekeeper. It must earn the open.

- Keep it under 8 words
- Never use clickbait or all-caps
- Options: curiosity-driven, specific value reference, or name/company drop
- **Examples:**
  - `Connecting [Their Company] with [Audience/Opportunity]`
  - `Quick question re: [their initiative]`
  - `[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out`
  - `[Specific result] for [their industry]`

---

## EMAIL LENGTH & TONE RULES

| Element | Guideline |
|---|---|
| Total length | 150–250 words (no more) |
| Tone | Conversational, confident, peer-to-peer |
| Paragraphs | Short — 2–3 sentences max each |
| Formatting | Plain text preferred; no bullet walls |
| Personalization | Minimum 2 specific references to the prospect |
| Jargon | Avoid — write how you speak |

**Subject:** Connecting African Sales Company with South Africa's R250B LGBTIQ+ Market

**[COMPONENT 1 — CONNECTION]**
Hi Lauren, I came across your impressive background in luxury cosmetics and fashion — 20+ years shaping brands and driving strategic growth is no small feat. Your work with high-end fragrances like Givenchy L'Interdit and Cartier Carat speaks to a keen understanding of exclusivity and audience engagement.

**[COMPONENT 2 — SPECIALTY]**
I'm with MambaOnline, South Africa's leading LGBTIQ+ digital platform (40,000+ monthly visitors, 23 years of community trust). We work with premium brands looking to engage with audiences that are often overlooked by mainstream media strategies.

**[COMPONENT 3 — POSSIBLE PROBLEM OR DESIRE]**
We find that brands with your positioning are increasingly looking for ways to reach high-income, loyalty-driven consumers who actively seek out brands that reflect their values.

**[COMPONENT 4 — POSSIBLE VALUE]**
We help brands like yours tap into R250B in annual purchasing power — with 60% of our audience holding degrees and 44% in management roles. These are discerning consumers who actively prefer brands that engage authentically with LGBTIQ+ platforms.

**[COMPONENT 5 — END RESULT]**
For our partners, this has translated into measurable lifts in brand affinity and new audience acquisition — particularly around Pride Month campaigns, targeted digital placements, and editorial features.

**[COMPONENT 6 — CTA]**
I'd love to ask a few questions about your current brand initiatives to see if there's a fit worth exploring. Would you be open to a quick chat next week?

## COMMON MISTAKES — NEVER DO THESE

- ❌ Starting with "I hope this email finds you well"
- ❌ Talking about features instead of outcomes
- ❌ Using vague language like "cutting-edge solutions" or "best-in-class"
- ❌ Asking for a sale, demo, or meeting in the first line
- ❌ Writing more than 250 words
- ❌ Using a connection line that could apply to anyone
- ❌ Stacking multiple CTAs
- ❌ Listing problems without confidence — state them as insights, not guesses
- ❌ Skipping quantification in Component 5 when data is available
